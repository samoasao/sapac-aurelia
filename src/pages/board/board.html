        bio="Carrie Stusse grew up in the Midwest and was first introduced to
        musical theatre in junior high

        the junior high swing choir and continued with the school choir in high school. After high
        school, she recognized her amateur singing talent; however, she still enjoys watching and
        listening to the talent of others.
        After moving to Tucson, Carrie obtained a degree in English while pursuing her interest in
        volunteering to help others. She’s always recognized the importance of nonprofit organizations
        for communities and looks forward to using her passions for writing and helping others to
        support SAPAC through grant research and writing.">
