              <strong>Carrie Stusse</strong> - Carrie Stusse grew up in the Midwest and was first introduced to
              musical theatre in junior high
              by her music teacher, Mrs. Popejoy. It began with West Side Story, and soon after, Carrie joined
              the junior high swing choir and continued with the school choir in high school. After high
              school, she recognized her amateur singing talent; however, she still enjoys watching and
              listening to the talent of others.
              After moving to Tucson, Carrie obtained a degree in English while pursuing her interest in
              volunteering to help others. She’s always recognized the importance of nonprofit organizations
              for communities and looks forward to using her passions for writing and helping others to
              support SAPAC through grant research and writing.
