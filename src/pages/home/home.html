                    Southern Arizona Performing Arts Company (SAPAC) is a 501(c)3 nonprofit organization of unified
                    local
                    artists committed to
                    bringing high-quality theatrical performance to the Tucson area. We believe in the power theater has
                    to
                    entertain,
                    edify, and connect audience members and performers alike. SAPAC creates opportunity for local
                    artists in all
                    aspects of theater to learn and grow in a professional atmosphere while fostering a positive effect
                    on the
                    community,
                    building empathy and connections throughout Tucson. </p>

                100 minutes, 26 performers, 16 stories and 1 pandemic. Jason Robert Brown wrote the music 
                and lyrics to these songs with a common theme...how one moment can change our lives forever. 
                Join us as we have gathered performers from all over the country to convey a modern interpretation 
                to these classic songs by relating them to our current pandemic. Proceeds from this performance will 
                go to the Tucson Performing Arts fund which was developed to help local artists financially during 
                this time.
