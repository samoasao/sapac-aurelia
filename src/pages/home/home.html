                    edify, and connect audience members and performers alike. SAPAC creates opportunity for local
                    artists in all
                    aspects of theater to learn and grow in a professional atmosphere while fostering a positive effect

                <p>Writing a musical is hard! Just ask Jeff and Hunter, two struggling writers, scrambling to write a
                    musical to submit to a theatre festival. With the deadline looming, and with nothing to lose, the
                    pair enlists the help of their friends Susan and Heidi (with Larry on the piano), and decide to try
                    and create something exciting and new. What you get is four friends writing a musical about four
                    friends writing a musical: meta-theatre at its most hilarious! This Tony-nominated musical is sure
                    to leave you laughing!</p>

                <p>This hilarious and ‘HOT’ updating of Gilbert and Sullivan’s comic masterpiece weaves a sharp witted,
                    fun-filled tale where - despite life or death stakes - characters still find time to tap their toes
                    and croon their troubles away. Set in a fictionalized Japan, at a time when outlandish laws harshly
                    sentence people for almost any indiscretion, it is the language of jazz, gospel and the blues that
                    is spoken most fluently. <em><strong>Hot Mikado</strong></em> thrills by combining traditional
                    Japanese storytelling with the
                    big band sights and sounds of popular American song and dance.</p>

                    Long before <strong><em>Hamilton</em></strong>, there was three-time Tony Award-winning
                    <em>1776</em> – the original American
                    Revolution Musical! It’s a long, hot summer in Philadelphia, and the Continental Congress
                    is at each other’s throats. The nation is on the brink of revolution – if only our founding
                    fathers can agree to sign the declaration. American history blazes to vivid life in this
                    extraordinary musical, revealing the humor and humanity behind these national icons. With a
                    limited 2-performance run, you won’t want to miss our modern re-shaping (including nontraditional
                    casting) of this hit show!
